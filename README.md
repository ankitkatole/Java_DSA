<h2>üìö Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my <strong>Java and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong> learning repository! This repository contains a curated collection of Java code examples, exercises, and projects that I've worked on while learning the key concepts of Java and DSA.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è About This Repository</h2>

<p>This repository serves as a personal learning hub where I upload and maintain my practice code as I learn Java and DSA. It includes solutions to common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving exercises, along with projects to demonstrate these concepts in real-world applications. It is designed to be a reference for both myself and others who are also on a journey to master Java and DSA.</p>


<h2>üöÄ Getting Started</h2>

<p>To run the code examples and projects from this repository on your local machine, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure you have <strong>Java 17</strong> (or later) installed on your system. You can download it from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Clone this repository using Git:</li>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ankitkatole/Java_DSA.git</code></pre>
  <li>Navigate to the project folder:</li>
  <pre><code>cd Java_DSA</code></pre>
  <li>Run the Java files using your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode) or from the command line:</li>
  <pre><code>javac filename.java</code></pre>
  <pre><code>java filename</code></pre>
</ol>

<h2>üíª Usage</h2>

<p>This repository is designed for learning and practice purposes. You can use the code here to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Study and understand Java and DSA concepts.</li>
  <li>Solve coding challenges and improve problem-solving skills.</li>
  <li>Reference algorithms and data structures for your own projects.</li>
</ul>
